/*
This HOC component is used for calculating count of button clicks and numnber of times the div is hovered. 

The count increment is common in both buttonClick and divHover components. 

instead of repeating the same functionality in both components, we are using HOC component.

HOC takes a wrapper component as input and returns the new enhanced component.
